      Your extreme ghost-hunting, pellet-nabbing, food-gobbling, unstoppable

      DESCRIPTION: The idea is to prioritize states with higher current game score and those states
      with more potential as determined by the features. As a side note, trying to prioritize
      power pellets directly seems to be a bad idea unfortunately.

      "Optimal" coefficients for the following features were found through trial and error.

      Features used:
      Current game score
        - Used as a baseline
      Inverse of total food distance
        - Used to prioritize states where Pacman is closer to food
        - Because total distance is used, sometimes Pacman will first ignore a
          small amount of food in favor of a large amount of food that is far away
      Distance from ghosts only if they are very close
        - ðŸ‘» Ghosts are only scary when they are close after all ðŸ‘»
        - Used to make Pacman wait next to a power pellet to ensure a kill on a nearby ghost
            - Though sometimes Pacman will spare the ghost in favor of food
        - Also used to make Pacman run away from ghosts when they're not scared
      Total time that ghosts are scared for
        - Used to incentivise grabbing power pellets so ghosts can be treated as food
